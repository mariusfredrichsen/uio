Tensors are used to encode the inputs and outputs of models, as well as the models' parameters. A tensor can be made from a Numpy array, and can be cast to a Numpy array.

In your case, it will be the original tensor transformed by the sigmoid function. However, the default assumption of PyTorch is that the backward pass starts from the final *loss* value which is scalar - but your final data point is a vector. To avoid errors, simply convert the final tensor into a scalar before running the backward pass: for example, by applying `.sum()` on it.\n",
