    "Especially, notice that you are **not allowed to use code or parts of code written by others** in your submission. We do check your code against online repositories, so please be sure to **write all the code yourself**. Read also the \"Routines for handling suspicion of cheating and attempted cheating at the University of Oslo\": https://www.uio.no/english/studies/examinations/cheating/index.html By submitting this assignment, you confirm that you are familiar with the rules and the consequences of breaking them.\n",

    "**Deadline**: Friday, February 28 2025, 23:59\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission should be delivered in Devilry. You may redeliver in Devilry before the deadline, but include all files in the last delivery, as only the last delivery will be read. You are recommended to upload preliminary versions hours (or days) before the final deadline.\n",
