### Exercise 1 (Parallelism and concurrency)
Yes, I think so. This is because when running concurrent processes you can run multiple processes that use the same resources which might be in the cache. Instead of running a single process that uses a set of resources then laster uses another, after that run another process that uses the same resources, but this time the cache is filled with some other resources.

### Exercise 2 (Synchronization)
```
string buffer ; # contains one line of the input
bool done := false;
process Finder { # find patterns
string line1 ;
while (true) {
    wait for buffer to be full or done to be true;
    < **await** (buffer != null || done)> 
    if (done) break;
    line1 := buffer ;
    signal that buffer is empty;
    look for pattern in line1;
    if (pattern is in line1)
        write line1;
    }
}
process Reader { # read new lines
    string line2 ;
    while (true) {
        read next line of input into line2 or set EOF after last line;
        if (EOF) {done := true; break;}
        wait for buffer to be empty;
        < **await** (buffer = null) >
        buffer := line2 ;
        signal that buffer is full;
    }
}
```




### Exercise 3 (Producer-consumer)
```
**int** buffer;

**process** Producer {
    **int** a[N]; p := 0;
    **while** (p < N) {
        < **await** (buffer = null) >
        buffer := a[p];
        p := p+1;
    }
}

**process** Consumer {
    **int** b[N]; c := 0;
    **while** (c < N) {
        < **await** (buffer != null); >
        b[c] := buffer;
        buffer := null;
        c := c+1;
    }
}
```

Base it more on the buffer itself since its already global.



### Exercise 4 (Executions and atomicity)
```markdown
**int** x := 0, y := 0;
**co**
    x := x + 1; # S1
    x := x + 2; # S2
||
    x := x + 2; # P1
    y := y − x; # P2
**oc**
```

#### 1. Atomic
If each of the assignments is a atomic operation then we get the following interleavings:
S1,S2,P1,P2: x=5, y=-5
S1,P1,S2,P2: x=5, y=-5
S1,P1,P2,S2: x=5, y=-3
P1,S1,S2,P2: x=5, y=-5
P1,S1,P2,S2: x=5, y=-3
P1,P2,S1,S2: x=5, y=-2
(x,y) exists in {(5,-5), (5,-3), (5,-2)}

#### 2. Three atomic operations
(2*6)! / (6!²) = 924

(x,y) exists in {(3,-3), (5,-5), (5,-3), (5,-2), (2,-2), (4,-4), (4, -2), (4, -3)}



### Exercise 5 (Angles brackets)
#### 1. Possible values
(x,y) exists in {(5,15), (8,6)} 

#### 2. Remove angle brackets, 3 atomic operations, possible values?
(x,y) exists in {(5,15), (8,6), (5,6)} 



### Exercise 6 (AMO)
#### AMO
S1 - yes
S2 - yes
S3 - no

#### Final values
y=0 and (x=0 or x=1 or x=2)



### Exercise 7 (AMO, termination)
#### 1. AMO
Yes, every operation contains at most one critical reference

#### 2. Terminate?
Sometimes
