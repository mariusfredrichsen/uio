# Embeddings and ANN indexes
- Approximate Nearest Neighbours

- The amount of dimensions of words in the vocabulary
- Sparce vectors, vectors with 0 in value (the word doesnt exist in the document)

### Word representation
- Bag of words model
    - one hot enconding
        - represented by one bit position in a HUGE vector

- Voronoi diagrams, colored areas, if a point is in a colored area then that point belongs to the colored class

- Locality-Sensitive Hashing
    - uses collisions to create a "category"

- Quantization or Clustering-Based Algorithms

- Graph Based Methods
    - create the graph hierarchically
    - is a edge between two nodes if they relate to each other
