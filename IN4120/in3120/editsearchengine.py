    Realizes a simple edit distance lookup engine, that, given a larger set of strings encoded
    in a trie, finds all strings in the trie that are close to a given query string in terms of edit
    distance.
    
    See the paper "Tries for Approximate String Matching" by Shang and Merrett for details. This
    implementation assumes that we set an upper bound on the allowed edit distance (treating anything
    above this bound as infinity and non-retrievable), and that this upper bound is relatively small.
    Imposing a small upper bound allows us to prune the search space and make the search reasonably
    efficient.
