# Assignment C-1

**Deadline:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Task

The purpose of this assignment is to implement a simple query evaluator that efficiently performs _n_-of-_m_ matching over a simple memory-based inverted index. I.e., if the query contains _m_ unique query terms, each document in the result set should contain at least _n_ of these _m_ terms. For example, 2-of-3 matching over the query _orange apple banana_ would be logically equivalent to the following predicate:

```text
(orange AND apple) OR (orange AND banana) OR (apple AND banana)
```

Note that _n_-of-_m_ matching can be viewed as a type of "soft `AND`" evaluation, where the degree of match can be smoothly controlled to mimic either an `OR` evaluation (1-of-_m_), or an `AND` evaluation (_m_-of-_m_), or something in between.

The evaluator should use the client-supplied ratio _t = n/m_ as a parameter as specified by the client on a per query basis. For example, for the query _john paul george ringo_ we have _m = 4_ and a specified threshold of _t = 0.75_ would imply that at least 3 of the 4 query terms have to be present in a matching document. You can infer _n_ as:

```python
n = max(1, min(m, int(t * m)))
```

The results should be ranked and yielded back to the client according to relevancy. For example, continuing the previous example, it is reasonable to expect that a document that contains all of _orange_, _apple_ and _banana_ to be ranked above a document that contains _orange_ and _apple_ but not _banana_. How many documents to be returned should be controlled on a per query basis as specified by the client.

Note that _m_ above is assumed to be the number of unique query terms. For the 3-term query _bye bye baby_, _m = 2_ and we say that the term _bye_ has multiplicity 2 and the term _baby_ has multiplicity 1. The multiplicity can be taken into account by the ranker.

Your task is to:

* Familiarize yourself with the precode.
* Implement the missing query evaluation code in the `SimpleSearchEngine` class.
* Ensure that the code is correct and passes all tests.

Your solution should only contain edits to the file [`simplesearchengine.py`](../in3120/simplesearchengine.py). Changes to other files will be ignored.

## Notes

Implementation notes:

* The `SimpleSearchEngine` class implements a simple search engine that evaluates queries as specified. We are given a corpus and an inverted index built over that same corpus.
* Use document-at-a-time traversal to implement the query evaluation. Your implementation must not iterate over the full corpus, but should iterate over multiple posting lists in parallel.
* Relevancy scores are assessed using a ranker object that we pass in to the query evaluation routine. You can use the `SimpleRanker` class for this.
* The `Sieve` class is useful for sifting the relevancy scores so that we are left with only the best-ranking documents.

## Extras

Some optional bonus challenges for the interested student:

* Can you implement a better ranker? Note how `SimpleRanker` gives equal weight to stopwords and more information-carrying terms.
* How would you use your implementation to realize a simple search engine that was capable of approximate matching, e.g., where the query _organik kemmistry_ matched documents containing the terms _organic chemistry_?
* How would you extend and modify your implementation to include ideas described in [this](../papers/efficient-query-evaluation.pdf) paper?
