# Science Fair

**Deadline for group self-assignment:** 2025-10-27\
**Deadline for topic selection:** 2025-11-10\
**Date of science fair:** 2025-11-17

For IN4120 students the course will end the semester with a science fair. Participation in the science fair is mandatory for IN4120 students, and distinguishes IN4120 from IN3120. You don't get a grade but will have to participate and pass to be allowed to take the final exam.

Students are divided into groups of 2 people. You can self-organize and find a partner, or you can have a partner randomly assigned. Please let me know by the abovementioned deadline if you have self-organized and with whom, otherwise I will apply my mad matchmaking skillz and pair you up with a partner. Please let me know if you need to be paired up with a partner. Also, if you want to form a 1- or 3-person group for whatever reason, please let me know about that, too.

Each group should prepare a 5-10 minute long presentation on a selected topic. The presentation will be given to the rest of the class including IN3120 students. Groups can self-organize and pick their own topic, under the following conditions:

* The chosen topic has to be approved by me. Please let me know your selected topic by the abovementioned deadline at the latest. If you want ideas for topics, see below or ask me.
* Two groups are not allowed to give a presentation on exactly the same topic. If two groups happen to select the exact same topic, the group that first contacts me "wins". Typically, if there is a topic collision, this is easily solved by focusing on different aspects of the chosen topic.

Your chosen topic should be somehow relevant to the course. Examples include continuations of or deep-dives into topics covered by the course, or fun areas not covered by the course but related to search technology. The best presentations (and the easiest ones to hold and prepare for) are on topics you think are fun and are passionate about. Be creative! Example ideas to get you started include:

* Pick one of the papers distributed as part of the course. Present the ideas and results outlined in your chosen paper!
* Each obligatory assignment contains "some optional bonus challenges for the interested student". Pick one or more of these and report back with your implementation and findings!
* Parts of the textbook aren't covered by any of this year's lectures. Select a topic from one of the uncovered sections!
* There are a large number of open-source systems and libraries available for search and large-scale document processing. Pick one, and explain what it does and how it works!
* Extend the precode in a fun, interesting or useful way! E.g., make selected in-memory index structures disk-backed, or add nifty features!
* Pick a topic that links something search-related to the planned topic of your master's thesis!

You can choose to present in either Norwegian or English, whatever you're the most comfortable with. Mixing languages (e.g., slides in English but presenting in Norwegian) would work, too. And if you, for whatever reason, cannot present in person or on the scheduled date, we can almost certainly accommodate for that somehow.

Lastly, note that the science fair is a very low-key and informal event. No grade, no judgment. Never has a chosen topic not been approved by me, and as long as you participate you'll pass. Don't take it too seriously, you're not defending a PhD thesis. Relax, have fun, enjoy the ride, and learn something new. ðŸ™‚
