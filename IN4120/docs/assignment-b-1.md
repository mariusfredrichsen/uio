# Assignment B-1

**Deadline:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Task

The purpose of this assignment is twofold:

* Build a simple [suffix array](../papers/suffix-arrays.pdf) and implement "phrase prefix searches" using this. For example, for a supplied query phrase like _to the be_, we'd return documents that contain phrases like _to the bearnaise_, _to the best_, _to the behemoth_, and so on. I.e., we require that the query phrase starts on a token boundary in the document, but it doesn’t necessarily have to end on one.
* Given a [trie](../slides/strings-galore.pdf) ("dictionary") with a potentially very large number of entries (words and phrases of arbitrary length), implement a simplified version of the [Aho-Corasick algorithm](../papers/efficient-string-matching.pdf) that efficiently detects the subset of dictionary entries that also occur within a given text buffer. For example, if the dictionary contains _harry potter_ and _wizard_, we'd efficiently detect the presence of these strings within the buffer _a wizard named harry potter_. Detected entries should start and end on token boundaries. If entries overlap in the document then all matches should be reported.

Your task is to:

* Familiarize yourself with the precode.
* Implement the missing indexing and evaluation code in the `SuffixArray` class.
* Implement the missing code in the `StringFinder` class.
* Ensure that the code is correct and passes all tests.

Your solution should only contain edits to the files [`suffixarray.py`](../in3120/suffixarray.py) and [`stringfinder.py`](../in3120/stringfinder.py). Changes to other files will be ignored.

## Notes

Implementation notes:

* It might be a good idea to draw the data structures on a piece of paper before you start coding, to get clarity on how this should work.
* The `SuffixArray` class implements a simple suffix array, ignoring LCP information. We create a suffix array from a corpus (i.e., a collection of documents) as represented by the `InMemoryCorpus` class. After having indexed the corpus (or at least a specified set of fields in the documents) and created a `SuffixArray` object, we can query this and locate matching documents.
* Note that a document might match the query in multiple places. The documents should be ranked according to the match count, and emitted back to the client in ranked order. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module might come in handy for this.
* For lookups, your implementation of `SuffixArray` must for typical searches be logarithmic in the number of suffixes in the corpus. The `bisect` module might come in handy for this. Its memory usage should also be sane, e.g., to represent a suffix use an integer index into the full string instead of making a new copy of the suffix string itself. When implementing searches across multiple document fields, you can assume that the Unicode character [`NULL`](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0000/index.htm) does not appear in normal text.
* A naïve construction of the suffix array is fine for this assignment. By naïve is meant building up an array that represents the possible suffixes, and then simply sorting this using a built-in sort.
* The `StringFinder` class scans the buffer once and finds all dictionary entries that occur in the given text buffer. The dictionary itself is assumed represented by the `Trie` class.
* Your implementation of `StringFinder` can ignore the part about failure transitions as described in the Aho-Corasick paper, for the purpose of this assignment.
* For lookups, your implementation of `StringFinder` must for typical searches be linear in the size of the input buffer and almost insensitive to the size of the dictionary. Matches should be yielded back to the caller in the order in which they appear in the input buffer.
* For text normalization and tokenization purposes, you can use the `SimpleAnalyzer` class.

## Extras

Some optional bonus challenges for the interested student:

* The `SuffixArray` class doesn’t compute or make use of LCP information. Extend your implementation to include this.
* Extend your `SuffixArray` implementation with a lookup mode that requires that matches also end on token boundaries, thus making this a proper phrase search.
* The `StringFinder` implementation finds and reports all matches, even if they overlap or include each other. For example, if the dictionary contains both _manchester united_ and _united nations_ then both entries would be reported within the buffer _manchester united nations_. Extend your `StringFinder` implementation with an option to do leftmost-longest matching, thus possibly suppressing some matches.
* Experiment with alternative normalizers together with `StringFinder`, e.g., to do case-sensitive matching, case-insensitive matching, phonetic matching, stemmed matching, and so on. How can you make sure to report back matches and ranges relative to the original input buffer?

ss, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes\nequations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock\nstructure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary conditions\n.  a simp
ler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/\nconditions where the shock may no longer be considered an infinitesimally\nthin discontinuity but where it has not thickened\nsufficiently to entail the /ful
ly merged layer/ analysis .  in this\ncase we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying conservation\nlaws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses,\nand heat conduction .\n  for a sphere and

 connection with hypersonic flow\nproblems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to\nillustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations\nhave been performed for a sphere and cylin

ere\nusing the incipient merged layer approximation .\n  results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear,\nand heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled\nsphere flying at hyp
ersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds\nnumber, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above\nthe extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer\nregime and then to begin falling in the
 incipient merged regime .\nas the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged\nregime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static\nand stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease .\n  c
alculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with\ndecreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime,\nthe density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy behind\nthe shock and a
t the stagnation point increase so that they\nare higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the stagnation-point\npressure behaves like the total enthalpy .\n  for the highly cooled cylinder in the vis
