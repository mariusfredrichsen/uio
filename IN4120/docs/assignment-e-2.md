# Assignment E-2

**Deadline:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Task

The purpose of this assignment is to explore alternative embedding methods and/or approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) index structures, and to compare these with the `SimilaritySearchEngine` implementation in [`similaritysearchengine.py`](../in3120/similaritysearchengine.py).

The `SimilaritySearchEngine` class uses [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to generate the embedding vectors, and [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) to realize the ANN index. You can continue to use these libraries, if you want, e.g., by pulling in other spaCy models, or by passing other arguments to the FAISS index factory, or by using the GPU-version of FAISS instead of the CPU-version (if you have a GPU), or by specifying another index type argument to the FAISS index factory. Or, if you want, you can opt to replace one or both of these with alternative open-source libraries.

Your task is to:

* Familiarize yourself with the precode.
* Implement an alternative embedding generation implementation of your choice and/or an alternative ANN index structure. You can make use of suitable open-source libraries.
* Devise and run selected experiments where you quantitatively compare the provided `SimilaritySearchEngine` implementation with your alternative implementation.
* Write a short report that summarizes your experiments, observations and findings. You are expected to cover speed, scalability, and search quality aspects.

Your deliverables for this assignment include the source code you write, plus the report.

## Notes

Implementation notes:

* To facilitate comparisons, it's recommended that you copy `SimilaritySearchEngine` into a new class `MySimilaritySearchEngine` and work on this.
* In addition to exploring alternative embedding methods and/or approximate ANN index structures, if you want you can also make `MySimilaritySearchEngine` more scalable by adding support for batching.
* To investigate speed and scalability differences, search the web for a larger corpus if none of the supplied corpora in the [`data`](../data/) folder sufficiently push the boundaries.
* Make sure you have a sensible test battery as you develop your code as "proof" of working code, and create new unit tests as needed. You may or may not want to extend and tweak the tests in `TestSimilaritySearchEngine`. See example output below for inspiration.

Report notes:

* Strive for clarity: What did you do? Why did you do it? How did you structure and run your experiments? What are your findings and observations? How do your experiments support your conclusions?
* Critique your work: How could you have improved things further? How confident are you in your conclusions? What could you do to make your claims even more scientifically valid? What are possible sources of errors in your experiments?
* Keep it structured: Summarize the important things in the body of your report. Stuff details in an appendix. Consider adhering to the [IMRAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD) structure.
* Be concise: You are not writing a PhD thesis. But the body of your report must be at least 600 words.
