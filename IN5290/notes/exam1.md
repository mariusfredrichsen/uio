## Kopi av Task 1.
Write five different reasons why we see so many security vulnerabilities. Describe each in one or
two sentences.
- 

## Task 2.
Write two different cases where WHOIS has to be used. Explain both, including why we use it,
what we hope to obtain, and how to proceed afterward.

## Task 3.
We know that the site backpaw.cutecats.com has an active SSH service, and we would like to
determine its type and version number. You are restricted to using only nmap. Explain what types
of scans and parameters you would use, considering all realistic use cases, such as the service
owner attempting to hide the service, ICMP being disallowed, etc.

## Task 4.
Name one configuration error vulnerability in DNS. Explain why it can be advantageous for an
attacker

## Task 5.
How can THC-Hydra be used for web hacking? Provide an example and list the necessary inputs
that Hydra requires (syntax is not needed). What happens if there is no response from the target
website when using Hydra?

## Task 6.
What is Cross-Site Request Forgery? Explain it with an example. How can it be prevented?

## Task 7.
Explain boolean-based blind SQL injection. Describe a scenario where union-based exploitation is
not possible, but boolean-based blind exploitation is feasible

## Task 8.
Explain the return-to-libc binary exploitation technique. What is its downside compared to return-
oriented programming?

## Task 9.
Describe heap spraying. In which situations do we need to use heap spraying, and why?

## Task 10.
Write a social engineering email designed to trick a user into clicking on a link (referred to as
"link"). The email text should combine two social engineering techniques: moral obligation and
trust based on provided information. You do not need to create a real phishing website—just
create the email text. The target person can be a fictitious individual or the lecturer of the course.

## Task 11
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using vulnerability scanners? List three typical
characteristics of a web vulnerability scanner.

## Task 12.
Define promiscuous mode and monitor mode. In which situations do we use promiscuous mode,
and why? Name a tool capable of using promiscuous mode.
