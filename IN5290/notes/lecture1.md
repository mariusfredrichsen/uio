# Introduction to Ethical Hacking, Information Gathering

## Why ethical hacking is necessary at all?
- computer systems have several security problems
- the reasons for the issues:
    - lack of money, time, expertise
    - negligence
    - convenience
    - old systems
    - too complex systems
    - 3rd party components
- triangle, complexity/functionality, security, usability/conevenience

## The goal of hacking
- break the infromation security triple
    - confidentiality
    - integrity
    - availability
- to promote security obviously

## Type of hackers
- black hat, hacking with milicious intent
- white hat, perform penetration testing to promote security

## Steps of a n attack with available info
1. information gathering, collect information about the target
2. technical information, collect network and system specific information like target ip ranges
3. attack surface, find which computers or machines that can be attacked
4. vulnerabilities, automatic vulnerability scanning then manual verification of the findings
5. EXPLOITATION
6. opening channels
7. obtaining private information
8. using the target for attacking other computers
9. clean up after yourself, leave no traces

## OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tools
- Maltego, collecting information using various sources
- Shodan, IoTs (Internet of things?), vulnerabilities in IoTs
- Google dorks, special search engine expressions
    - site:
    - intitle:
    - filetype:
    - google hack database, ghdb, contains searches for hacking or finding osint
- Metagoofil, collecting metadata
- Recon-ng, modular information gathering tool
- Checkusernames.com, users on social media
- TinEye, reverce image search
- Knowem.com, social media profiles
- Darksearch.io

## Collecting information from webpages
- wget or Httrack
- noisy but useful
- static information
